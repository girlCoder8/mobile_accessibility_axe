## Prerequisites
* NPM
* NodeJS
* Selenium Webdriverjs
* Appium

## Installation

You will first need Appium installed on your machine. Follow the instructions here: https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/?lang=en

Then simple run  "npm i" to install all of the dependencies


## Integration information

At its core, Appium uses WebDriver protocols to drive iOS and Android applications or web applications. Since it uses WebDriver protocols, this means we can use something like axe-core to run as asynchronous JavaScript in the browser, and get the results back!

The first thing to do in your project is install @axe-core/webdriverjs package. This package is an axe-core integration that actually works in tandem with WebDriver (Selenium) to do all of the axe-core injection into the browser for you!

In order to use axe with Appium we will need to install axe-cores webdriverjs package.

    "@axe-core/webdriverjs": "^4.3.1",
